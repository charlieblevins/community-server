There are a few things it still needs to do, and it is very important every implementation does this: * If the input identifier ends with a slash, it should be assumed the identifier is targeting a container. * Similarly, if there is no trailing slash it should assume a document. * It should always throw a NotFoundHttpError if it does not have data matching the input identifier. * DataAccessors should not generate containment triples. This will be done externally using `getChildren`.",
