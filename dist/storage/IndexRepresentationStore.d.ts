/**
 * Allow containers to have a custom representation.
 * The index representation will be returned when the following conditions are fulfilled:
 *  * The request targets a container.
 *  * A resource with the given `indexName` exists in the container. (default: "index.html")
 *  * The highest weighted preference matches the `mediaRange` (default: "text/html")
 * Otherwise the request will be passed on to the source store.
 * In case the index representation should always be returned when it exists,
 * the `mediaRange` should be set to "\*âˆ•\*".
